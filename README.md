# Udacity-ML-Projects

여기에 올라온 파일들은 제가 Udacity에서 기계학습 수업을 들으며 진행한 프로젝트들 입니다.

Files in these folder are my project reports of Udacity Machine Learning classes.

## 1)finding_donors
#### Course : [NanoDegree] Introduction to Machine Learning with TensorFlow - Machine learning project
#### Object 
: Making a predicting model that can predict a person would donate or not
#### Sequence
: Using census datasets (age, job, education, etc....) 
: Searched informations of each machine learning models and chose 3 of them: AdaBoost, SGCD, SVC.
: Playing those models with test sets, AdaBoost shows the best result. 
: Optimize AdaBoost model with GridSearch - Improved a little (increases in accuracy and f-score)
: Pick 5 most important features affecting the result and test again with reduced datasets
: Reduced dataset shows bad result
